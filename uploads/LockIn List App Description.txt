Project Name: LockIn List
1. Project Objective
To create a simple, single-page web application that helps users with executive functioning challenges translate long, unstructured text (like a teacher's email) into a clear, scannable, and actionable to-do list.
The app's primary goal is to answer the question: "What am I supposed to do next?" It should reduce overwhelm and provide a clear first step, but it must not do the user's work for them.
2. Target Audience & Tone
 * User: 15-year-old male (high school sophomore).
 * Problem: Feels overwhelmed by dense blocks of text and isn't sure what the required tasks, deadlines, or time commitments are.
 * Tone: Casual, direct, supportive, and non-clinical. It should feel like a helpful "cheat code" for organizing, not a medical tool or a productivity app for a CEO.
3. Core User Story
 * User receives a confusing, multi-paragraph email from a teacher.
 * User copies the entire email text.
 * User opens the "LockIn List" web app.
 * User pastes the text into a simple text area.
 * User clicks a single button (e.g., "Lock In" or "Get the List").
 * App sends the text to the Gemini AI for processing.
 * App displays a clean, simple, and prioritized list of tasks, deadlines, time estimates, and a "First Step" suggestion.
 * User now feels "locked in" and knows exactly what to do and how long it should take.
4. Key Features (MVP)
 * UI - Input: A large, simple, and obvious text area (e.g., "Paste your email here...").
 * UI - Action: A single, prominent button to submit the text.
 * UI - Output: A clean, uncluttered display area for the resulting list. This should use clear headings (e.g., "YOUR LIST," "DUE," "FIRST STEP").
 * UI - Time Estimates: Display an AI-generated time estimate next to each task (e.g., "Write 300-word analysis: ~45 mins").
 * UI - Clear Button: A button to clear the input and output to start over.
 * Loading State: A simple loading indicator (e.g., "Thinking...") while the AI is processing.
5. AI & Technical Requirements
 * Framework: Single-file HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), and JavaScript.
 * AI Model: Use gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025 via the generateContent API call.
 * Core Logic (AI System Prompt): The most important part. The JavaScript fetch call to the Gemini API must include a strong system instruction.
Recommended System Instruction (for the AI call):
> "You are 'LockIn List,' an AI that helps students who feel overwhelmed. Your job is to read a block of text (like a teacher's email) and turn it into a simple, clear, actionable to-do list. The user is a 15-year-old high school sophomore.
> CRITICAL RULES:
>  * DO NOT do the homework, write any part of the assignment, or answer questions.
>  * ONLY extract tasks, deadlines, and materials.
>  * ALWAYS identify the very first, smallest step the user should take (e.g., "Open the PDF," "Create a new doc," "Read the two poems").
>  * ADD TIME ESTIMATES: For each task, provide a reasonable time estimate in minutes or hours (e.g., "~30 mins," "~1 hour"). Base this on a typical 15-year-old high school sophomore's workload.
>  * FORMAT your response clearly. Use simple bullet points.
> Example Output Structure:
> TASKS:
>  * Write a 300-word analysis. (~45 mins)
>  * Upload it to the 'Poetry' portal. (~5 mins)
> DUE:
>  * This Friday (before class).
> FIRST STEP:
>  * Open the "guiding questions" PDF. (~10 mins)"
